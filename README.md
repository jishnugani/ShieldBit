# ShieldBit

## Inspiration
With the increasing nature of digital threats, I have had an urge to equip users with knowledge and practical ways. This venture is more than coding; it is an obsession with establishing a safer internet environment. It’s all about belief in knowledge being power. We do not only aim at knowing what phishing is but we teach people about cyber threats. This is not just a call for defense; it’s asking users to campaign for cyber security Awareness through engagement, thus enabling digital resilience as we move forward.

## What it does
- **Cryptography Mini Games**: This feature helps users learn about cryptography and boost their knowledge in cybersecurity through engaging mini-games.

- **Phishing Quiz and Information**: This section creates awareness about phishing attacks, providing information as well as quizzes that can help users identify and avoid phishing attempts.

- **Phishing Email Detector**: This tool uses machine learning to determine whether an email is safe or not. By the utilization of the Naive Bayes algorithm coupled with a dataset from Kaggle, anyone can copy-paste an email into the input box and get its classification.

- **Domain Analysis**: The security of a domain may also be checked by taking into consideration such things as SSL certificates, domain age, and patterns revealed in suspicious domains. WHOIS API gives comprehensive safety reports based on these checks.

## How we built it
Flask was used for ShieldBit’s backend while Python was utilized in implementing machine learning algorithms. The Phishing Email Detector was trained using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle. On our part, we employed Bootstrap to bring about a responsive and user-friendly interface for the front end.

## Challenges we ran into
Developing a project in cybersecurity means dealing with technical intricacies, and challenges that we faced when coding, implementing machine learning strategies, and making tools safe. One of the greatest difficulties is to get an idea of the narrow scope of cyber security.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the interactive games we created in cryptography, the all-around knowledge theft content on phishing attacks, and the interactive quiz section development. We also managed to design a Phishing Email Detector and Domain Analysis tool. Thus, these accomplishments together highlight the magnitude and depth of our project highlighting a multi-pronged cybersecurity approach that includes technical excellence, innovation, and user education.

## What we learned
We got practical experience developing a web application with Flask as a backend framework and Python as the programming language. We learned how to use machine learning approaches such as the Naive Bayes algorithm to detect phishing emails. Our project enabled people with different talents to come together, working together in an environment that encouraged our strengths to complement each other towards one common purpose.

## What's next for ShieldBit
The next step would be to incorporate a database for recording all reported phishing domain names. For instance, we can make improvements to the existing tools by adding more features that will enhance user experience. We are aiming at maintaining an updated version of ShieldBit whereby it will remain ahead in keeping track of the newly emerging and most inclusive cyber-attack protection solution available online.
